# Conditional Access as Code

Introducing Conditional Access as Code. A fully automated solution to kick-start and maintain your Conditional Access deployment. The solution consists of three main components.

## Policy repository
A collection of conditional access policies in JSON format which are divided into the following categories:
* Admin protection
* Application protection
* Attack surface reduction
* Base protection
* Compliance
* Data protection

## Policy sets
Policy sets are based on the policies in the repository and form complete policy sets depending on company maturity and licensing:
* Bare minimum
* Device trust with AADP1
* Device trust with AADP1 and AADP2
* Device trust with AADP2
* Network trust with AADP1
* Network trust with AADP1 and AADP2
* Network trust with AADP2
* Your custom policy set

## Automation solution
A script based automation solution to deploy and update policy sets in environments.

**Together, these three components enable an extremely fast deployment of conditional access concepts and their long-term maintenance, e.g. in the form of source control.**

Although I work for Microsoft, this is not an official recommendation, I exclude any liability and warranty. This is only a personal recommendation which has to be implemented with the utmost care and testing.
