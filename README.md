# Conditional Access as Code

In an nutshell this repository does two things:
* It provides sets of conditional policies as JSON files that can be deployed to your tenant with a PowerShell script. The same script can also be used to update your conditional access policies and manage them as code.
* The wiki has plenty of information around designing conditional access policies and fitting them to your organization. While automation is a honorable goal you should first care about WHAT your policies should do, get the most esential policies enabled and develop your organiations strategy to further improve your maturity. Most likely an initial deployment of a policy set is more than enough before you dive into compley management as code.

# Get started with the [Quick-start wiki](https://github.com/AlexFilipin/ConditionalAccess/wiki#quick-start)

Although I work for Microsoft, this is not an official recommendation, I exclude any liability and warranty. This is only a personal recommendation which has to be implemented with the utmost care and testing.
